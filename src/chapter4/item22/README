ITEM 22 : USE INTERFACES ONLY TO DEFINE TYPES

-- Interfaces should be used only to define types. The interface can then be used to refer to the instances of the class
that implement the interface.

-- Constant interfaces fail this test, they just contain constant static fields with no methods. If a class needs to
use them, it exports them by implementing the interface
    -- Confused the user of the class.
    -- Use of constants by the class is an internal implementation detail, implementing interface for that leaks that
    detail in the exported API.

-- Several other better mechanisms to export constants
    -- If tied with the class/interface using it - add them directly there.
    -- Otherwise use enum type.
    -- Lastly, can also be exported from a static utility class that is non instantiable - by making the
    constructor private or class final.
        -- Use the static import facility to avoid qualifying the constant name with the class name.
