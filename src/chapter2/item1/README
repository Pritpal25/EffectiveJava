Item 1 demonstrates how using static methods for constructors can provide 3 advantages

ADVANTAGES OF STATIC FACTORY METHODS
a) These methods have names as opposed to constructors
    -- Avoids you from writing constructors that just differ in the order of their parameters.
b) They can have in built logic to return the same object at every invocation.
    -- Boolean.valueOf(boolean) never created new instances each time its invoked.
    -- Helps save time if object creation is expensive.
    -- Immutable value classes can guarantee that no 2 equal instances exist.
    -- Use Interface as return type and send implementations in return.
        -- Collection Interface has Collections static factory class which returns the instances of non public
            implementations.
c) They can also return the subtype of the return type, as opposed to the constructors.

DISADVANTAGES
a) Classes without public/protected constructors cant be subclassed.
    -- One has to manually get rid of the default constructor provided by compiler by making it private.
b) SFM dont show up in public API - so hard to figure out how to get instance of a class.
