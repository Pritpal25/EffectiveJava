ITEM 30 : FAVOR GENERIC METHODS

-- Like Generic Types, generic methods are also preferable.
-- They provide type safety at compile time and eliminate the need for explicit casts. (See SetUnion)

-- Recursive Type Bound : Type parameter bound by an expression involving type parameter itself.(See RecursiveTypeBound)
    -- E extends Comparable<E> : read as, any type E that can be compared with itself.

-- Summary
    -- Generic methods are safer and easier to use than methods that required clients to put casts on input params
     and return values.
    -- Make such methods generic, and it can be done without breaking existing clients.
